## ðŸ“Š Problem Definition

- **Dataset:** Airbnb NYC listings data (`airbnbListingsData.csv`)  
- **Prediction Goal:** Will a listing receive a high rating?  
- **Label:** `high_rating` (1 if review score â‰¥ 4.5, else 0)  
- **Problem Type:** Supervised learning â†’ Binary classification  

**Features Considered:**
- Price  
- Availability (`availability_365`)  
- Host attributes (e.g., superhost status, response rate, acceptance rate)  
- Number of reviews & reviews per month  
- Neighbourhood group  

### Why This Problem Matters
Accurate predictions of high-rated listings can help Airbnb:
- Highlight quality listings at the top of search results  
- Provide insights to hosts on how to improve  
- Enhance guest satisfaction and trust in the platform

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** â€” Load the dataset and prepare it for analysis  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€” Understand trends, distributions, and feature relationships  
3. **Feature Engineering** â€” Create and refine features for model input 
4. **Model Training** â€” Train classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) 
5. **Model Evaluation** â€” Assess performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score  
6. **Model Improvement** â€” Tune hyperparameters and improve model results
